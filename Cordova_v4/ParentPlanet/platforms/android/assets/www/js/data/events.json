Most recently\\, Dr. Mary Blair started a new project in Vietnam to inform and improve the management of the illicit wildlife trade\\, which continues at high levels despite increased efforts to control illegal activities. Trade management policies based on biological research alone cannot address the socioeconomic context and drivers of wildlife trade. Dr. Blair is advancing interdisciplinary research to inform more effective wildlife trade management by integrating biological\\, anthropological\\, and socioeconomic data\\, focusing on a particular group of endangered primates for which exploitation from wildlife trade is its greatest threat: the nocturnal and elusive slow lorises. With support from the National Science Foundation\\, her team is currently surveying across Vietnam for slow loris population status in the wild (http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/(tag)/6871)\\, and uses genetics and morphological analyses to identify the species and geographic origins of slow lorises found in the trade. Also\\, based on interviews with hunters\\, sellers\\, and consumers of wildlife\\, Dr. Blair will build an econometric model of wildlife trade in Vietnam that incorporates variation across scales\\, improving our understanding of the complex drivers of wildlife trade in this important region.\\n\\nAnd here’s a bio for me if that is useful:\\nDr. Mary E. Blair is the Assistant Director for Research and Strategic Planning at the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Her research integrates molecular techniques with geographic information systems (GIS) modeling to understand the evolutionary processes that generate biodiversity and the influence of environmental variability on evolutionary divergence. She also explores how knowledge of evolutionary processes can inform conservation planning and the spatial prioritization of conservation actions. She is an NSF Science\\, Engineering\\, and Education for Sustainability Fellow and teaches at the Richard Gilder Graduate School and Columbia University. http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/mary-blair","params":{}},"geo":null,"lastmod":{"value":"20140520T211724Z","params":{}},"location":{"value":"Perkin Room","params":{}},"organizer":null,"priority":null,"dtstamp":{"value":"20140522T025749Z","params":{}},"seq":{"value":"0","params":{}},"status":{"value":"CONFIRMED","params":{}},"transp":{"value":"OPAQUE","params":{}},"url":null,"recurid":null,"duration":null,"uid":{"value":"fkquo7idjppqm53fs5qehiklhg@google.com","params":{}},"summary":{"value":"Mary Blair \\\\ AMNH","params":{}},"dtstart":{"value":"2014-06-08T18:00:00.000Z","params":{}},"dtend":{"value":"2014-06-08T19:00:00.000Z","params":{}}},{"klass":null,"created":{"value":"20140424T182220Z","params":{}},"description":{"value":"Constraining the CV evolution with SW Sex stars and old novae\\n\\nFrom a large observing campaign\\, we find that nearly all non- or weakly magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) in the orbital period range between 2.8 and 4 hours are of SW Sex sub-type and as such experience very high mass transfer rates.

However\\, with each passing year\\, we make significant advances towards achieving this goal. Young gas giant planets can now be directly imaged\\, giving us clues to their atmospheric compositions—the kind of information we will one day seek for Earth 2.0. In the meantime\\, several other questions need to be answered: What do other planetary systems look like? What is the connection between planets and debris disks? Do the ingredients necessary for life exist around other stars? \\n\\nIn this talk\\, I will present research results on four different topics related to answering these questions. First\\, I will discuss my work on radial velocity (RV) eccentricity bias. For years astronomers have been puzzled about the large number of RV-detected planets that have eccentric orbits (e > 0.1). I will show that this problem can be partially explained when two circular-orbit planets masquerade as a single planet on an eccentric orbit. I use this finding to predict that planets with mildly eccentric orbits are the most likely to have massive companions on wide orbits\\, potentially detectable by future direct imaging observations. Second\\, I will present direct imaging results on an old RV planetary system—an attempt at combining two powerful planet detection techniques that will one day be crucial for determining the true mass distribution of extrasolar planets. I will also discuss a new program I am leading to image long-period companions with MagAO. Third\\, I will present direct imaging results on several bright debris disks (including a brand new one) in the visible and near-infrared using the LBT and MagAO. Imaging at these wavelengths is a window into the composition of the dust grains scattering the star light\\, allowing us to determine how much (if any) water ice and/or organic materials are present. Finally\\, I will present my bold foray into theory to understand and characterize the observational signatures planets dynamically leave on debris disks. I will show how bigger planets create broader disks\\, meaning we can use debris disk widths to estimate an interior shepherding planet's mass. This will prove especially useful to planet imagers in the coming years for both searching for and characterizing new disk-shepherding planets.\\n","params":{}},"geo":null,"lastmod":{"value":"20140507T190131Z","params":{}},"location":{"value":"Perkin Room","params":{}},"organizer":null,"priority":null,"dtstamp":{"value":"20140522T025749Z","params":{}},"seq":{"value":"0","params":{}},"status":{"value":"CONFIRMED","params":{}},"transp":{"value":"OPAQUE","params":{}},"url":null,"recurid":null,"duration":null,"uid":{"value":"4c3fj6h5ukjc3m2m37qv96kjb4@google.com","params":{}},"summary":{"value":"T.

To investigate these inconsistencies\\, we used the 1.3 millimeter full-Stokes polarimeter at CARMA to map dust polarization with ~2.5\" resolution toward 29 star-forming cores and 8 high-mass star-forming regions as part of the TADPOL survey.  We find that a subset of the sources have consistent B-field orientations between the large (~20\") scales measured by single-dish submillimeter bolometers and the small scales measured by CARMA. Those same sources also tend to have higher fractional polarizations\\, presumably because the B-fields are less twisted by dynamic effects. However\\, even in these sources\\, which seem to have retained the memory of the global B-field direction\\, the fields in the cores are misaligned with the disks and outflows in the central protostars -- a key previous result of the TADPOL survey.  Furthermore\\, the protostellar cores with lower polarization fractions tend to have B-fields that are preferentially perpendicular to outflows\\, which suggests that in these sources the B-fields have lost the memory of the larger-scale global field\\, and have been wrapped up by core rotation.

In this sense\\, one of eta Car’s many mysteries has now been resolved\\, making its dominating wind properties more “normal” than once thought.\\n","params":{}},"geo":null,"lastmod":{"value":"20131007T220403Z","params":{}},"location":{"value":"","params":{}},"organizer":null,"priority":null,"dtstamp":{"value":"20140522T025749Z","params":{}},"seq":{"value":"0","params":{}},"status":{"value":"CONFIRMED","params":{}},"transp":{"value":"OPAQUE","params":{}},"url":null,"recurid":null,"duration":null,"uid":{"value":"0dkrlh0qna36nn2gtn0kjdbqps@google.com","params":{}},"summary":{"value":"Tony Moffat / U Montreal","params":{}},"dtstart":{"value":"2013-10-20T18:00:00.000Z","params":{}},"dtend":{"value":"2013-10-20T19:00:00.000Z","params":{}}},{"klass":null,"created":{"value":"20130826T174250Z","params":{}},"description":{"value":"The Mass-Transfer Formation of Blue Stragglers as Revealed by their White Dwarf Companions \\n\\nThe formation mechanism of blue straggler stars\\, defined to be brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff in a star cluster\\, has been a question for almost six decades. The blue straggler population of the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 provides a unique opportunity to probe the formation histories of blue straggler stars in open clusters. In comparison to the blue straggler populations in younger open clusters and in globular clusters\\, the cooler temperatures (6\\,000 to 6\\,750 K) and close proximity (2.5 kpc) of the blue stragglers in NGC 188 allow for in-depth high-resolution spectroscopic investigation. Long-term radial velocity studies revealed that over 75% of the NGC 188 blue stragglers exist in binaries with a prevalence of 1000-day periods and a statistical secondary mass distribution that peaks at 0.5 Msolar. Using HST/ACS/SBC far-UV photometry I will present direct observational detections of young (<300 Myr)\\, hot white dwarf companions in three blue straggler binaries. Given the age distribution predicted in full N-body models\\, which translates into a white dwarf temperature distribution\\, three detections is consistent with the entire NGC 188 blue straggler population being formed via mass transfer. These detections affirm the prediction made by previous studies that the blue straggler population of NGC 188 is dominated by mass transfer formation.","params":{}},"geo":null,"lastmod":{"value":"20131007T220245Z","params":{}},"location":{"value":"","params":{}},"organizer":null,"priority":null,"dtstamp":{"value":"20140522T025749Z","params":{}},"seq":{"value":"0","params":{}},"status":{"value":"CONFIRMED","params":{}},"transp":{"value":"OPAQUE","params":{}},"url":null,"recurid":null,"duration":null,"uid":{"value":"9op18dapg4lpoivesuvq9rnl94@google.com","params":{}},"summary":{"value":"Natalie Gosnell / Wisconsin","params":{}},"dtstart":{"value":"2013-11-05T18:00:00.000Z","params":{}},"dtend":{"value":"2013-11-05T19:00:00.000Z","params":{}}},{"klass":null,"created":{"value":"20130827T183921Z","params":{}},"description":{"value":"HI and CO observations of Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies: Evolutionary Implications\\n\\nLuminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) are ~L*\\, blue\\, high surface brightness\\, starbursting galaxies with an underlying older stellar population.

However\\, what drives their evolution and into what types of galaxies they evolve remains unclear.  We have undertaken a multi-wavelength survey of local LCBGs\\, selected to have the same physical properties as higher redshift LCBGs\\, in order to address these questions.  In this talk I will present the results of a detailed HI and CO study of 20 nearby LCBGs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as preliminary results from an expanded HI survey of 163 local LCBGs (original and archival data).  We find local LCBGs to be diverse\\, but overall gas-rich and prolifically forming stars.  The majority will consume their neutral hydrogen quickly\\, within 2 Gyr.  Their dynamical masses are consistent with low-mass galaxies\\, such was dwarf ellipticals\\, dwarf irregulars and late-type (Magellanic) spirals.  If local LCBGs are indeed analogs to higher redshift LCBGs\\, it is unlikely distant LCBGs will evolve into today's population of massive ellipticals\\, grand-design spirals or dwarf spheroidals.","params":{}},"geo":null,"lastmod":{"value":"20130924T143605Z","params":{}},"location":{"value":"","params":{}},"organizer":null,"priority":null,"dtstamp":{"value":"20140522T025749Z","params":{}},"seq":{"value":"0","params":{}},"status":{"value":"CONFIRMED","params":{}},"transp":{"value":"OPAQUE","params":{}},"url":null,"recurid":null,"duration":null,"uid":{"value":"gtlipn1v5and1bksd5oqehgvt0@google.com","params":{}},"summary":{"value":"Catherine Garland / Castleton","params":{}},"dtstart":{"value":"2013-10-13T17:00:00.000Z","params":{}},"dtend":{"value":"2013-10-13T18:00:00.000Z","params":{}}}]
